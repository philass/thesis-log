Change CLI/test.hs so that options came before binpath so we could pass options to the node runner

Program executes like so after changes
```
futhark test --backend=wasm-multicore test.fut --runner="node"  --pass-option="--experimental-wasm-threads"
```

I need to make sure to export more memory for EMCC so that ^ runs.

Node hangs and doesn't exit but other than that it seems to work.
